### SpiNNaker system configuration
#
# Settings for the SpiNNaker machine which will be used to simulate Nengo
# models. 

[spinnaker_machine]
hostname: <host name of the machine here>
width: <width of the machine here>
height: <height of the machine here>

# Required parameters are:
#   - hostname: (string) either the hostname or the IP address of the board
#         containing chip (0, 0).
#   - width: (int) width of the machine (0 <= width < 256)
#   - height: (int) height of the machine (0 <= height < 256)
#
# Optional parameters are:
#   - "hardware_version: (int) Version number of the SpiNNaker boards
#         used in the system (e.g. SpiNN-5 boards would be 5). At the
#         time of writing this value is ignored and can be safely set to
#         the default value of 0.
#   - "led_config": (int) Defines LED pin numbers for the SpiNNaker boards
#         used in the system.  The four least significant bits (3:0) give
#         the number of LEDs. The next four bits give the pin number of the
#         first LED, the next four the pin number of the second LED, and so
#         forth. At the time of writing, all SpiNNaker board versions have
#         their first LED attached to pin 0 and thus the default value of
#         0x00000001 is safe. 
# 
# For a Spin3 board connected to 192.168.240.253 this section would look
# like:
# 
# hostname: 192.168.240.253
# width: 2
# height: 2
# hardware_version: 3
# led_config: 0x00000502
#
# For a Spin5 board connected to 192.168.1.1 this section would look
# like:
# 
# hostname: 192.168.1.1
# width: 8
# height: 8
# hardware_version: 5
# led_config: 0x00000001
