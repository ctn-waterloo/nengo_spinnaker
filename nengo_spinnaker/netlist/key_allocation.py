    An operator may be partitioned into a number of vertices which are placed
    onto the cores of two SpiNNaker chips.  The vertices on these chips form
    two clusters; packets from these clusters need to be differentiated in
    order to be routed correctly.  For example:

        +--------+                      +--------+

    Packets traversing `(a)` need to be differentiated from packets traversing
    `(b)`.  This can be done by including an additional field in the packet
    keys which indicates from which chip the packet was sent - in this case a
    single bit will suffice with packets from `(A)` using a key with the bit
    not set and packets from `(B)` setting the bit.

    This method will assign an ID to each cluster of vertices (e.g., `(A)` and
    `(B)`) by storing the index in the `cluster` attribute of each vertex.
    Later this ID can be used in the keyspace of all nets originating from the
