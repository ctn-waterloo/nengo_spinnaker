Code for SpiNNaker executables
==============================

The SpiNNaker executables require [`spinnaker_tools`
v2.0.1](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/downloads/) to build.
If this is available then, after sourcing the `setup` file in the
`spinnaker_tools` directory and making `sark` and `spin1_api`, the Nengo
executables may be built by calling `make` in this directory.
